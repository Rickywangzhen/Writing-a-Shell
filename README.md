What I want to do today is a c shell. 
The goal is that the input instruction can be executed and the pause function can be realized. 
I intend to use getchar ( ) to get the input instruction. Then use " system call" to use the obtained instruction.
Fork instruction is needed here. Otherwise, there will be errors
